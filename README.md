# configs

this streamlines uploading configs to the main server

how it works:

whenever the server is started, it pulls the latest changes from this repo

and uploads them to the server before the minecraft side starts. 

this speeds up the workflow significantly by cutting the middleman (me) out the equation of uploading files to the server
